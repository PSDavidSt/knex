   "description": "Online providers frequently offer a variety of services, ranging
from news to mail. These providers endeavour to keep
users accessing and interacting with the sites offering these
services, that is to engage users by spending time on these
sites and returning regularly to them. The standard approach
to evaluate engagement with a site is by measuring
engagement metrics of each site separately. However, when
assessing engagement within a network of sites, it is crucial
to take into account the traffic between sites. This paper
proposes a methodology for studying networked used engagement.
We represent sites (nodes) and user traffic (edges) between
them as a network, and apply complex network metrics
to study networked user engagement. We demonstrate
the value of these metrics when applied to 728 services offered
by Yahoo! with a sample of 2M users and a total of
25M online sessions.",
   "hypothesis": "",
   "future_work": "We did not apply complex networks metrics that calculate
the centrality of nodes. These metrics can bring further insights
in networked user engagement, and in particular when
compared and combined with engagement metrics (such as
those listed in the introduction). We also did not differentiate
between the ways users navigate between services,
whether clicking on a link, using the back button, or using a
bookmark. We can build additional types of networks where,
for instance, two sites are connected if there are web links
between them. The same methodology can bring insights
into how web links influence networked user engagement.
Finally, the source of the traffic (e.g. users that come from
a news or social media site) and its effect on networked user
engagement is something that is important to investigate.
Our ultimate aim is to understand how a network of sites
and the traffic between sites can be optimised to “better”
engage users. The methodology presented in this paper constitutes
the first step towards achieving this aim.",
