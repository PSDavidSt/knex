   "description": "Users often access and re-access more than one site during
      an online session, effectively engaging in multitasking. In
      this paper, we study the effect of online multitasking on
      two widely used engagement metrics designed to capture
      users browsing behavior with a site. Our study is based
      on browsing data of 2.5M users across 760 sites encompassing
      diverse types of services such as social media, news and
      mail. To account for multitasking we need to redefine how
      user sessions are represented and we need to adapt the metrics
      under study. We introduce a new representation of user
      sessions: tree-streams – as opposed to the commonly used
      click-streams – present a more accurate picture of the browsing
      behavior of a user that includes how users switch between
      sites (e.g., hyperlinking, teleporting, backpaging). We then
      discuss a number of insights on multitasking patterns, and
      show how these help to better understand how users engage
      with sites. Finally, we define metrics that characterize multitasking
      during online sessions and show how they provide
      additional insights to standard engagement metrics.",

   "future_work": "Our next steps are two-fold. First, our definition
      of a task is simplistic and should be extended. For
      example, to book a holiday, a user may visit several sites
      within the same session and one site many times across
      several sessions. It will be important to re-align our findings
      and conclusions with a more general definition of task.
      Moreover, we need to further study when a user is returning
      to a site to continue with the same task (continue reading
      the news articles) or to start a totally different task (a new
      unrelated information need), as these two cases should be
      treated differently. Accounting for this will likely lead to
      more advanced models of user attention to a site, an important
      research direction to follow. Second, we focused on two
      metrics used to assess the browsing activity within a visit.
      We did not consider, for example, bounce or click-through
      rates. It will be important to extend our study to a larger
      set of metrics, including those related to other aspect of user
      engagement, such as loyalty and popularity [11]. In addition,
      the concept of page view is not well defined with dynamic
      changes to a web page such as in Ajax, so we would like to
      address this issue too. Finally, we did not take user demographics
      into account and how multitasking on sites differ
      in different countries.",
