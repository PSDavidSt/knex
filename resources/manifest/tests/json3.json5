   "description": "This analysis studies the impact of the new “search-by-tag”
feature on listening time on Android. The results show a positive
overall impact and that there is cannabalism between the new
“search-by-tag” feature and the playlist filter on the search
results page.
In detail: No impact on number of likes, but small positive impact on listening time. When looking at feature level, we observe that users use the search-by-tag feature instead of search (cannibalism).",

   "future_work": "We recommend to run another experiment that investigates how the feature would perform when directly integrated into search.",
