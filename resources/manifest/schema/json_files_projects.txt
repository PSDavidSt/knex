   "description": "Users often access and re-access more than one site during
an online session, effectively engaging in multitasking. In
this paper, we study the effect of online multitasking on
two widely used engagement metrics designed to capture
users browsing behavior with a site. Our study is based
on browsing data of 2.5M users across 760 sites encompassing
diverse types of services such as social media, news and
mail. To account for multitasking we need to redefine how
user sessions are represented and we need to adapt the metrics
under study. We introduce a new representation of user
sessions: tree-streams – as opposed to the commonly used
click-streams – present a more accurate picture of the browsing
behavior of a user that includes how users switch between
sites (e.g., hyperlinking, teleporting, backpaging). We then
discuss a number of insights on multitasking patterns, and
show how these help to better understand how users engage
with sites. Finally, we define metrics that characterize multitasking
during online sessions and show how they provide
additional insights to standard engagement metrics.",
   "hypothesis": "",
   "future_work": "Our next steps are two-fold. First, our definition
of a task is simplistic and should be extended. For
example, to book a holiday, a user may visit several sites
within the same session and one site many times across
several sessions. It will be important to re-align our findings
and conclusions with a more general definition of task.
Moreover, we need to further study when a user is returning
to a site to continue with the same task (continue reading
the news articles) or to start a totally different task (a new
unrelated information need), as these two cases should be
treated differently. Accounting for this will likely lead to
more advanced models of user attention to a site, an important
research direction to follow. Second, we focused on two
metrics used to assess the browsing activity within a visit.
We did not consider, for example, bounce or click-through
rates. It will be important to extend our study to a larger
set of metrics, including those related to other aspect of user
engagement, such as loyalty and popularity [11]. In addition,
the concept of page view is not well defined with dynamic
changes to a web page such as in Ajax, so we would like to
address this issue too. Finally, we did not take user demographics
into account and how multitasking on sites differ
in different countries.",

   "description": "Online providers frequently offer a variety of services, ranging
from news to mail. These providers endeavour to keep
users accessing and interacting with the sites offering these
services, that is to engage users by spending time on these
sites and returning regularly to them. The standard approach
to evaluate engagement with a site is by measuring
engagement metrics of each site separately. However, when
assessing engagement within a network of sites, it is crucial
to take into account the traffic between sites. This paper
proposes a methodology for studying networked used engagement.
We represent sites (nodes) and user traffic (edges) between
them as a network, and apply complex network metrics
to study networked user engagement. We demonstrate
the value of these metrics when applied to 728 services offered
by Yahoo! with a sample of 2M users and a total of
25M online sessions.",
   "hypothesis": "",
   "future_work": "We did not apply complex networks metrics that calculate
the centrality of nodes. These metrics can bring further insights
in networked user engagement, and in particular when
compared and combined with engagement metrics (such as
those listed in the introduction). We also did not differentiate
between the ways users navigate between services,
whether clicking on a link, using the back button, or using a
bookmark. We can build additional types of networks where,
for instance, two sites are connected if there are web links
between them. The same methodology can bring insights
into how web links influence networked user engagement.
Finally, the source of the traffic (e.g. users that come from
a news or social media site) and its effect on networked user
engagement is something that is important to investigate.
Our ultimate aim is to understand how a network of sites
and the traffic between sites can be optimised to “better”
engage users. The methodology presented in this paper constitutes
the first step towards achieving this aim.",
